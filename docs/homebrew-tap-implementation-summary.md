    name: hello-gopher
    homepage: https://github.com/louiellywton/go-portfolio
    description: "A friendly CLI tool for Go enthusiasts"
    license: MIT
    
    install: |
      bin.install "hello-gopher"
    
    test: |
      system "#{bin}/hello-gopher", "--version"
      system "#{bin}/hello-gopher", "greet", "--name", "Homebrew"

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

### Requirement 3.1 & 3.2 (Installation Methods)
- ✅ Homebrew tap configured for easy installation
- ✅ Installation command: `brew install louiellywton/tap/hello-gopher`
- ✅ Tool available in system PATH after installation

### Requirement 5.4 (Release Automation)
- ✅ Goreleaser configured to automatically update Homebrew tap
- ✅ Formula generation integrated with release process
- ✅ Tap updates automatically when releases are published

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

To complete the Homebrew tap integration, the following steps need to be performed:

### 1. Create the Homebrew Tap Repository

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub
# Repository name: homebrew-tap
# Owner: louiellywton
# Public repository (required for Homebrew)

# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/louiellywton/homebrew-tap.git
cd homebrew-tap

# Follow the setup guide in docs/homebrew-tap-repository-setup.md
```

### 2. Test the Configuration

```bash
# Run validation script
./scripts/validate-homebrew-config.sh

# Test locally (requires Homebrew)
./scripts/test-homebrew-tap.sh
```

### 3. Create a Release

```bash
# Tag a release to trigger Goreleaser
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Goreleaser will:
# 1. Build cross-platform binaries
# 2. Create GitHub release
# 3. Generate Homebrew formula
# 4. Update the homebrew-tap repository
```

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap louiellywton/tap

# Install the package
brew install hello-gopher

# Test functionality
hello-gopher --version
hello-gopher greet --name "Test User"
hello-gopher proverb
```
